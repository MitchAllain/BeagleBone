sim_0313_2153.csv,test discard
sim_0314_0113.csv,some missed subgoals but really pushing the limits of what I can run on the simulator - using UWTM
sim_0314_1338.csv,NWTM perturbations seem not strong enough
sim_0314_1442.csv,testing for strange alpha params
sim_0314_1447.csv,changed alpha mapping range
